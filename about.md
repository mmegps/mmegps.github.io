My name is Mohit Mehta. I am a proud member of a London based start-up with passionate people leveraging state-of-the-art technology to simplify professionalsâ€™ work-life.

This blog has been initiated to cover some musings of my passionate endeavours into the art and science of Management Innovation. I did my PhD in Management Innovation under Prof. Patrick Reinmoeller at Cranfield University.

My objective is to be able to offer meaningful ideas which improve lives of all around the organisation, and help us passionately and collectively push the frontiers of productive boundaries. This will encompass ideas ranging from leadership and management to current trends in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

I am inspired by the thinking of Gary Hamel.
