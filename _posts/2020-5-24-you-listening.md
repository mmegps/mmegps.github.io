Listening is a superpower.

Effective listening means tuning in to all verbal and non-verbal cues. It means being empathetic to converge on what is really being said.

Listening which looks simple is actually a complex process with multiple facets.

What you get when you listen is a subset of what is being said. A sort of projection. It will never be perfect, but it can reach close if you are good at it.

Effective listening is without any filtering. It relies on absorbing everything, even subtle non-verbal communication coming to you.

It does not mean thinking what to say next, or how you would like to respond. Nor the time to think how to get an upper edge or where the flaw is in the argument.

Instead, it is about paying attention, complete attention, and getting to the bottom of what is being communicated.

The process does not warrant the listener to fill in the gaps with his own opinion and views, but this is (unfortunately) inadvertent. The process, however, does require the listener to rationalise with logic and clarify so that they can understand better.

Listening also has another beautiful side to itâ€¦ it generates progress.

Effective listening forwards both of the participants in their understanding. One gains from the new understanding and the other from being understood.

It is important to note that, it is easy for the speaker to know if you are listening (or not). In fact, he relishes if you are, and struggles if you are not.

Among most listening variants, the most harmful is listening to what you want to listen. It nullifies any progress, taking both participants backwards.

So, next time take note. Listening is not about judging. It is about paying respect.

Do you have this superpower?
