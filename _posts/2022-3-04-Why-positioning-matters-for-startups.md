Every startup has a positioning. This positioning makes their identity. It is foundational - literally - and helps the startup generate a stance.

Clear and concise positioning is a make or break for a startup, because it helps reduction in ambiguity by facilitating clarity for all.

Strategy at a broad level is a precursor to positioning. Strategy defines where the organisation wishes to operate, and how it will win within the chosen playing field. It defines the boundaries where an organisation wants to compete in, and more importantly where it does not.

Here, the mention of “chosen playing field” is what leads to positioning, which is a structural artefact. Positioning helps with choices because it strengthens the understanding making every other thing clearer and simpler.

The association to choices here is important, especially the irreversible ones, because they have to be bold and are actually bets for opportunities fighting for limited resources within the startup.

So, strategic positioning => clear decision "choices" towards the problem => a “unique” product bundle towards value => firm “direction” for the organisation => “value creation” for all involved.

If positioning is understood, then identity and association emerges.

If positioning is clear, a startup can market itself to where it can shine.

If positioning is unclear, everything else looks like a competition. Alternatively, when the positioning is clear it helps focus by reducing the search space to justifiably follow your “real” competition.

Positioning is what marketing builds upon. It informs where the customers for the product are, and where marketing dollars are best spent, what channels, the distribution, and of course what partnerships.

Even within product engineering, adding features which are orthogonal to the primary positioning dilutes the proposition. Working to add more product may generate a little tick mark on the feature (if done well), but it will do more harm if it is not in alignment with the crisp positioning where the organisation wishes to make a mark. One simple reason for this is because it will be competing as an inferior addition against those other startups who have built around such a feature as their primary positioning.

Building a positioning and maintaining it also warrants care. Once seeded, cultivated and established it becomes your identity. It is what you are known for.

It is also not easy to change once established. It requires a lot of unlearning. Unlearning not only for visible tangible attributes like the product and processes but also deeply as cultural associations and acceptable/unacceptable thought patterns within the organisation. It really runs deep.

Some also call it a niche. So, find your niche, embrace it wholeheartedly and be the best.
