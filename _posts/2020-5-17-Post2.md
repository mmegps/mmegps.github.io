Why does work feel taxing and stressful, while play rejuvenates? Does it have to be so, what is missing and what can we do?

_“Work and play are words used to describe the same thing under differing conditions.” - Mark Twain_

Why don’t we think work as play, contribute our bit and see everybody around us and society grow? Do we all have a subconscious cringe when we come to work? Why can’t work be exciting and fun? Something which lets you exercise your talents and provides a satisfying experience.

One’s salary package is often called compensation because it is compensating for his time in office. Maybe this is the wrong footing to start with and makes your subconscious think “give and take”. Unfortunately, this is also complete odds with knowledge work, where one’s emotional presence and engagement plays a huge part.

If we are already exhibiting a high level of engagement, then perhaps we are not too far… Are we?

Another line of thought might be a naive understanding of siloed organisations that one’s job is limited to one’s role? Can this lead to disappointment when different factions are running at different speeds, and thus something slow is limiting your potential and speed? Can this take the fun out?

Can we design the system to take this element out of it to make this work day in and day out? i.e. a suitable support system/framework is evolved by the employees themselves, and where cross cultivation is promoted, encouraged and rewarded by peer recognition. Can such an environment be artificially created/promoted? This happens naturally in play.

Building this further, Can organisations let people chose what they want to do? Or, Are we told? I believe this can be a massive kick to one’s passion and bring natural accountability in the system?

Accountability is inherent in play. It is not written or enforced. It emerges and the players naturally expect it. Even the support system for a play emerges, it is rarely structured.

This also leads to another differentiator, which is the presence of “natural will”. This is key and in organisational terms “untapped potential”. What are we doing to align it to the tasks one is expected to perform?

A side note for Entrepreneurs/To-be-Entrepreneurs:

I feel that this is the exact thing why the majority of Entrepreneurs are playing (as a pun) while they are working. They have a knack to thrive in unstructured environments and sustain without enough support system and clarity. We should be able to extend this further and say “you either have it in your blood or do not”.

Also, many time often we see people wanting to start a start-up but never ready to jump. Is this the reason why?
