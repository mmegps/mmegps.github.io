Beginning with a quote from the legendary Peter Drucker:

_“The knowledge worker cannot be supervised closely or in detail. He can only be helped. But he must direct himself, and he must direct himself towards performance and contribution, that is, toward effectiveness.”_

As pretty clear from the title, a knowledge worker is someone who uses his knowledge for day to day work. He is a problem solver. He uses his skills and knowledge all the time to contribute to further his and his organisation's goals. His input (his thought process and problem-solving) is largely intangible, but his contributions quite noticeable and measurable. Each workday for him is different. He has to be on his feet to solve new problems and engage himself.

Reading the above, did you notice one’s “emotional connection” and “passion” with one's job hidden somewhere? These are desirable qualities, but is something which differs within ordinary and extra-ordinary, mediocrity and meritocracy. Knowledge work is not a 9-5 job.

Drucker’s quote carries great significance in this fast-paced age where an employee’s life is completely engulfed with information all around them. This quote is something which needs to be understood to give your employees the best so they can give the organisation their best. Passion here is a must-have ingredient of day to day work and acts as a multiplier of effort.

How can an organisation help employees bring out their fruits of passion into the workplace? Or, In other words, what can organisations do to be more productive? What does it mean for a knowledge organisation in the current knowledge era? Are our organisations in tune to get the best out of their best resource? Carrot and stick do not seem to work any more and will not work in future. Conventional management anyone…

What managers have to realise is that these are people they are dealing with and have their own lives to live. The output would be best if it is thought of as a community, and responsibility and progress are shared. Employees are not contracted but are thought of as part of the family. The primary and the only goal of management in this new age then reduces to engaging, enabling and empowering their people.

Initiating with this post, I would like to write a series of posts exploring and clarifying various aspects around this topic. I will also be researching and commenting on and what is being experimented out there, and off course what is working and what is not.

Closing up with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYaYwCA-FaM) video from Gary Hamel which states the point very succinctly and raises some more related questions and observations for transforming organisations and making them fit for the future…
