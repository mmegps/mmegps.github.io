10 or so years back, I heard this phrase the first time in a TWIST podcast episode from Jason Calacanis and got intrigued. He did mention it in a cautionary sense and I got intrigued.

The statement "If we build it, they will come" is from a 1989 film _Field of Dreams_, where a farmer hears a mysterious voice saying, "If you build it, he will come," and interprets it as a divine instruction to construct a baseball field in his cornfield. The phrase has since become a cultural metaphor for optimism, faith, and the belief that if you create something of value, people will naturally find and appreciate it.

For startups, however, this statement is both _tempting_ and _dangerously misleading_.

**Why "If we build it, they will come" is problematic for startups:**

1. **False Assumption of Demand:** The phrase assumes that customers will automatically appear once a product is built. In reality, most startups fail not because of poor technology or cleaver and innovative solutions, but because they build solutions to problems that don’t exist or problems that aren’t important/urgent enough for customers to pay for.
2. **No Market Validation:** The most common startup mistake is building a product in isolation, without testing the market or validating customer needs first. "If we build it, they will come" often leads to wasted time, resources, and opportunity cost especially when the product doesn’t align with customer pain points.
3. **Lack of Customer Focus:** Startups thrive on customer discovery, not just product creation. The real lesson from successful startups (like Airbnb, Dropbox, or Uber) is not that they built a product and people came, but that they iterated based on feedback, solved real problems, and made deliberate efforts to reach and engage their target users.
4. **Even more crucial for Enterprise startups**: In a total opposite for consumer startups, the feedback cycles for enterprise startups are even slower, so it takes a long time to even learn if something is resonating, let alone doubling down on what is working and the technical debt which has now been owned due to the investment.

**A Better Mindset: Build with them, Not for them.**

The correct mantra should be: **"If we build it _with_ them, they will come and stay."**

This means:

- **Start with empathy:** Understanding your customer’s struggles before writing a single line of code.
- **Validate early and often:** Use prototypes, surveys, and standalone minimum viable products (MVPs) to test assumptions. In other words, manual iterations and initially just some slideware to bounce off ideas for value works better, than integrated involved demos.
- **Engage actively:** Marketing, sales, and customer outreach are not afterthoughts, they are essential from day one.
- **Iterate based on feedback:** Build a feedback loop into your process. Build software for faster feedback, instead of perfect software.

While "If we build it, they will come" captures the romantic ideal of creation and success, it is a myth that undermines startup success. The most sustainable path for any startup is not passive faith in creation, but active, customer-driven innovation. Build with purpose, validate with customers, and grow through user engagement and not hope.

**Build with them, not for them.** Then, and only then, will they come.
