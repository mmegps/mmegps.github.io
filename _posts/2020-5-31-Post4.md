When the ask is clear, progress is faster. Why is that so?

Have you ever attempted driving in fog? If yes, you know what I mean and how it hampers your progress.

At a simplistic level, this means that with clarity on the ask, the scope is built into every forthcoming thought, thereby providing a natural boundary on expectations. Which means that an individual or a team can plan for it and therefore schedules have a higher likelihood of being met. There are plenty of simple examples of this all around us. e.g. writing a one-pager on the scope of the feature before implementation, a clear brief/mandate for the user experience design or even a meeting agenda before a meeting and what a good outcome looks like, is a great start.

The clarity for an organisation is actually more than the literal definition of clarity. When teams operate with clarity of purpose... magic happens. Let's unpack.

When there is clarity teams are mostly united, meaning on the same page, and everyone uses the same basis for all internal and external discussions. For start-ups, this clarity could only emerge by internally discussing the problem they are trying to solve? For whom? And then how they intend to solve it? This helps them plan better, and even help to say No to situations, where it does not make sense to dilute the efforts and lose focus.

It is vital to note that clarity is necessary not just on the specification, but also around the context. Clarity around the operating environment helps everyone to adopt a pragmatic approach to the market, partnerships, geographic focus etc.

With a crisper understanding, an organisation can perform to the next level with improved customer and product understanding for everyone, aligned product evolution and roadmap, greater sales focus (with confident No's as necessary), targeted marketing messaging which amplify the messaging, and confidence in customer support.

Clarity is also not a management instruction, instead, a joint responsibility of the team. As much as it seems to come from the leadership, everyone is responsible, and accountable for establishing it for the team. Though, an added responsibility for the leadership is to create a climate when clarity is revered and encouraged.

Clarity also has a relationship with organisational choices. They help and reinforce each other. Greater clarity reduces the cognitive load when making a choice, and making a choice increases the clarity to further build on.

Clarity also accelerates decision making within a team. With greater clarity, everyone can then make a decision at their own level without waiting for next level approvals. Broadly, knowing which direction to row in and with what rhythm. Clarity means the underlying values, purpose and direction are understood so that the decision making is faster, as a result, leading to progress.

Within knowledge work there does not exist a fixed boundary of contribution. One's output and ideas feed into the work of the next one in the chain and so on. This basically implies a common clear broad direction is even more important at each step and highly path-dependent. Therefore if an organisation is operating without enough clarity, the contribution at every stage would be un-optimal and often wasteful.

It is also vital to note that an increase in clarity does not mean cutting out innovation or being slow in execution. It only means we know what we are broadly after, before jumping all-in with passion. Innovation is in itself a process and clarity only helps accelerate it.

Organisations which understand the importance of this clarity, emphasise on this from the start and build determinism and high performance in their cultures.

So, next time you see things not progressing around you… Ask yourself… Is your ask clear?
