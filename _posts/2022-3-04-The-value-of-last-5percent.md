A good product is more than a collection of features.

It creates value. Value, which is generated when the product is consumed and not when it is made or distributed.

If this product is not clicking or not getting enough traction, then most often the reason is either it is solving an un-important problem , or it is still technically not refined enough and specific for it to be taken seriously.

This post is about the final journey a product takes from being a collection of features and technology to being something of use and value to the consumer.

Any right minded and focussed team with enough resource and intent can create a collection of features, code it well, make it robust and yes shiny. BUT, the value is delivered when the solution attunes to the user, and the features come together to make a difference.

A good product embeds the persona of the end user and evolves over time with refinements on user feedback. This is possible only when the design process is iterative, consultative and responsive. This helps reduce annoyances and increase delight.

It is important to note here that his user feedback is "selective". Meaning, every request need not be accepted, as it has to be thought through with regards to a “generalisable” positioning of the product and the core problem it intends to solve. The creator also has the benefit of having feedback from multiple users to triangulate on the areas of most improvement and the areas of annoyances, and all this is gold dust.

This last mile is usually about finesse in the experience so that it becomes effortless and natural for the user. It is not about another set of features bolted on to add notional paper value, but to emphasise and deliver the refinement which in turn makes the product a joy to use. It is an exercise in simplicity.

This effort is also about closing the loop. It is vital to define and design for "what's in it for me?" for everyone interacting with the product gaining something from it. This is a conscious exercise in motivational design, again progressing the product to value.

For example, consider a CRM product. It is typically used for managing the sales opportunity funnel within an organisation and for forecasting. The value it delivers should not only be for the manager who is interested in the forecast, but something also for the sales user who is providing the valuable inputs. He should also get something in return. Absent that, there is no joy in doing it under managerial pressure and forced compliance. Such one-way systems rarely work. Knowledge management systems also had a similar fate in the last couple of decades. So, the objective is to design for the sales user to also derive utility and pleasure for participating in the activity.

An approach frequently implemented in such scenarios is Gamification, which typically adds game-like mechanics to processes in order to enthuse and encourage participation. But these are superficial layers which do not really add any real meaningful motivational value for an average user (perhaps it does for a competitive user) which have been tried in the workplace or such systems.

Once the last-mile refinements are matured, the product is in a position which is difficult to copy. This is because the technology can surely be copied but the learning which has now been built into the product on how it solves the problem is invaluable and tacit. This is the holy grail for market leading products and proud teams creating them. It is not the parts, but how it all comes together, which creates value.
