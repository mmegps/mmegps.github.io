Yes experiments are now cheaper to do but does not mean every question is worth investigation. Is it?

Experiments are business-as-usual for startups. They help it move in incremental steps towards user traction and product market fit.

As defined by Steve Blank... "a startup is a temporary organisation designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model”. It is in the business of repeated small experiments in order to converge to a model through which it creates, delivers and captures business value. Therefore experiments are validation exercises and contextual learning constructs for a startup.

Even with potential course-determining properties, are all experiments worthy of the low cost and high yield they promise? What can be easily disguised as an experiment? and when is an experiment, not an experiment?

Let's unpack...

An experiment is a contextually-bounded measured change which delivers a learning. A learning can help extend you further on the same theme, or allow you to adapt and course correct. It has a high potential value as it is sacrificial in nature for the greater good. As a contextual premise, every startup is a testbed for small experiments. Experiments return some learning, generate confidence and help determine the next steps in the start-ups evolution.

Since all startups are crunched in resource, there will be experiments, which are just not worthy. Further, with decreasing cost of experimentation, how much can a startup do will always be limited. So select what you can do and design the experiment with clear expected takeaway and be prudent in selecting the experiments. And when you take them on, need to strive for maximum learning and utility.

Some obvious selection criteria could be to ensure if the hypothesis in question is aligned to the bigger question we want answered? or, if the benefit to cost ratio for running the experiment will be worth it? For example could it yield a 10x boost if it works?

But the most important point warranting an informed selection in my opinion is that even though access, availability and ability to do experiments has increased, any startup teams intellectual capacity, mind share and comprehensibility has remained the same. I mean any given team is still a collection of passionate individuals who are still humans with physical limits around their intellectual prowess. For example today you can buy and launch multiple cloud servers at the press of a button, but to run ten experiments in a fair manner which yield learning for your startup, does not scale in the same order. There are limits to what you can reasonably take a stretch to, and delight your customers.

Therefore an ability to do more experiments necessities the judicious judgement on selection on what to experiment. With more power comes more responsibility.

Actually I would go to the extent that in this age, not having enough ideas is almost never a problem… but killing the bad ones faster is. This also generates a competitive advantage.
