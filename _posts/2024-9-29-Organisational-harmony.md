An organisation is a collective.

It is the combined actions of a collective which determines where it goes.

Every member shapes the collective. Every action counts.

A collective's movement can only be proportional to its size.

If they are aligned, they move in great leaps.

If they are unaligned, they struggle to gain momentum.

Alignment generates progress and a good feeling.

When aligned, a collective becomes more than the sum of its parts.

Ideas flow freely, innovation thrives, and problems become opportunities.

Diverse thoughts, unified purpose—that's the sweet spot.

Alignment is not about uniformity. It's about harmony.

Misalignment, on the other hand, generates distrust and discomfort.

It is often silent, creeping in through assumptions and unspoken expectations.

Even one rower rowing in the opposite direction slows down progress.

Listen for the unsaid, as misalignment is a silent killer.

As organisations grow, alignment becomes harder.

Size brings complexity, which is why large companies often struggle to innovate.

Their collective is harder to steer. However, size also brings power.

When a large collective aligns, mountains move.

Executives are responsible for alignment. It cannot be "because I said so…"

It's the executive's job to listen, to sense the pulse, to adjust the course when needed.

They must explain the 'why' behind decisions.

Alignment is not a one-off effort. It's a constant process.

Like a garden, alignment needs tending—daily, hourly, with every decision.

This is why startups are able to move fast.

Repeated communication is always the key.

Communication is the lifeblood of alignment—not just words, but actions.

Leaders must embody the collective's values. Walk the talk, as it is said.

The collective thrives when each member feels heard, valued, and part of something greater.

Everyone must know the steps, but each adds their own flair.

Remember, in the grand orchestra of an organisation, everyone plays a crucial note.

Alignment is not control. It’s shared vision and shared passion.

An agenda everyone believes in, an outcome everyone is working towards in tandem.

In the end, it's not about individual brilliance. It's about collective harmony.

It is not just about conducting an orchestra. It is about being part of a jazz ensemble.

Listen, respond, adapt, and always, always keep the collective in tune.
