_Quality of the product… Sort of._

_Its usability… yes… yeah._

_Its UI/UX… ok._

_Its ability to solve a specific and important problem in a simple way... Yes, exactly._

See around you… the tools you see within an enterprise are average at best.

Some do not work as soon as you are off a prescribed path.

Some work only with particular versions of complementary software/browsers etc.

Some, you will feel, are trying too hard.

The ability to solve a specific and important problem are the largest determinants of a tool to be piloted, bought and be absorbed and routinised.

Both specific and important are vital here.

Specific because only then a product can be positioned against a problem. If it is not specific, it misses the context and therefore its boundaries become fuzzy and imprecise. This reduces its appeal for the client, who is aiming to get a product not a Swiss army knife, which he will need to learn to use effectively. Also, it dilutes the pricing appeal, because clients interested in a specific utility from this multi-purpose knife will question why are they paying for the feature-set they will never going to use.

It is also necessary for the problem to be Important because an organisation would always prioritise, sponsor and fund the most important problem it faces, and only occasionally the problems further lower in its immediate list. These low-importance problems will have to fight for the budget reducing the chances for the product to be attractive against others which are aiming for more significant problems within the organisational context.

The bigger the problem for the user or the organisation, the more chances it has to be get business attention, move rapidly in the commercials, and receive user traction when institutionalised.

Further, the more elegantly it solves a problem, the stickier it will be and more proud you will feel as its creator.

So, what is next in your priority towards a great product?
