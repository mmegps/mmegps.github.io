Life is very busy these days. Activity has become a synonym for progress. If we take a pause, it feels we are not progressing.

This I believe is plain wrong on multiple fronts.

We should all have a bias for action, but action requires another couple of qualifiers to convert into results namely thinking time and direction.

Thought helps with clarity. It achieves this by helping figure out boundaries and constraints on the problem at hand, which in turn aids creative expression, exploration and solutioning.

The other component, Direction helps bring consistency, sense of progress and fruitful achievement. It also helps teams and organisation collaborate and build on each others efforts toward fulfilment.

When acted on together, this thoughtful directional motion is what makes the difference for productive teams (and startups).

At an individual level, this thinking is not served by just being clear about what their job is, but what the organisation needs. Similarly, at a team level, it is not just about being agile, responsive and supportive to other teams needs and requirements, but being aware of the common vision and align with the rest of the organisation. Lack of clarity and confusion are formidable enemies here.

Converting activity into productivity is the biggest things one can do to improve his/her effectiveness. Everything here is written for an individual, but can be translated to a team or an organisation as well.

The legendary Peter Drucker has also commented, “Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results. By themselves, they only set limits to what can be attained.”

Busy also does not mean productive, in fact, mostly the opposite, as you may not even have time to think through, what you are busy with.

Thinking is crucial and saves un-necessary effort. Action without a thought, is wasteful, and even harmful. It can derail any noble intentions as it keeps one engaged with busy work.

The rise of meditation and mindfulness also indirectly address this concern. The mind never gets to rest. In the day time, it is occupied with your conscious and in the night time with your subconscious. it never sleeps.

Therefore working “smart” requires direction + thoughtfulness in action.

In this way one can add more meaning and achievement into his every day and translate his activity into productivity and eventually into effectiveness.
