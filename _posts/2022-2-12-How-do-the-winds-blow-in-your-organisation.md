Culture is NOT a set of values statement chosen by an organisation, or something seen in the group/offsite activities they may engage in once in a while, BUT it is the collective set of behaviours practiced within the organisation on a day to day basis.

Culture permeates... I mean it is already present when new members join the team and is usually absorbed by them, not the other way round. Most adapt to it, but some are shocked.

So, now think of your organisation and answer the following in a behavioural sense... These are meant to generate some thought ripples and put you into evaluation mode with respect to your organisation. So, let's begin...

Do team members trust each other? Do they practice trustworthiness, credibility and reliability within an environment of psychological safety?

Do they leverage their individual strengths? Are they understanding each other's limitations? Are they collectively strong?

Do the organisation's systems and processes support collaboration? Are they designed for an average performer to do good work OR designed for super-performers to act heroically?

How responsive are people to internal and external needs? Do they mostly act independently with good understanding, OR do they wait for permissions?

Is fairness, honesty and understanding the name of the game, OR Is manipulation required to get things done?

Do they consciously mix periods of change with periods of stability? OR Are they always in a rush?

Is your organisation truly in search of solving for the customer OR, Just in search for brownie points or generate some noise?

Do they celebrate internal and external accolades fair and often? Are these celebrations before or after the victories?

Is mutual respect in the air? Do most meetings start and end on time, or repeatedly overrun? Are colleagues repeatedly running late into meetings? Is a colleague's time valued?

Do people really listen to each other OR do they only selectively listen? Are some members into their phones or somewhere else in meetings?

Is the team willing and flexible to learn from experiences? In other words, constantly in search of answers, OR already have all the answers?

Do team members understand they have a course to run, OR running like headless chickens because the course is being adjusted all the time?

Does the best idea get a chance, OR the loudest idea?

By the way, nothing above is prescriptively advisable, good or bad. The organisational environment and circumstances should advise what behavioural action and culture is suitable against what context. e.g. In high velocity environments like startups, you want to be nimble, responsive and changing all the time. On the other hand, in utilities or heavy industries you may want to be slow to change, observe, plan and take time with large periods of stability, maintaining consistency and avoiding any shocks.

Therefore based on the organisational context the supporting cultural attributes may also vary widely, and uniquely define what is deemed acceptable and what is not.

Culture is not something which can be seen, but it sure can be experienced, like the wind, affecting everything from products, people and processes. A vital component which can make or break an organisation.

So, How do the winds flow in your organisation?
