A few years back I had read a note on the future of work by Thomas Malone, a professor at MIT.

The key take aways were build on the following two premises:

- Communication has become cheap and;
- Decentralisation is essential to do useful knowledge work.

I think there is another important key take away which can be developed from this…

De-centralisation can generate “speed” through purposeful alignment and autonomy.

All of us have seen that creative passion gets killed when it is under formal hierarchies, where layers of permissions and agreements are required i.e where the HQ decides first. For truly Innovation effort, every action cannot be tied to a business gain because some throw-away work will inevitably part of the process and even essential. Somehow hierarchical top-down organisations do not seem to conventionally believe in this. An Innovative mindset also expects deviating from a set strategy “some" of the time.

Centralisation may still be a useful strategy where economies of scale is the last bit of advantage remaining within an industrial/manufacturing setting. Reuse of common resources and central decision making is leveraged and understood for such organisations, but this somehow does not seem in tune with knowledge work where autonomy in necessary to be agile.

We are all knowledge workers today. Knowledge workers learn and adapt constantly as their jobs are rarely repetitive, and even if some parts are, they require constant improvisation with changing context. Knowledge workers problem solve in their day-to-day work, and therefore routinely come up with new and better ways of doing things. This has implications on necessary autonomy which becomes a necessity, and much more than a good to have for enhanced productivity.

In this backdrop, start-ups can to be different. Encouragement all around and freedom to express and execute can be a cornerstone. A startup will only be successful if it can align individual and organisational goals to lead towards a common purpose, and provide that freedom and free expression.

It is vital to note that although an agreement is necessary for everything, it just means that of-course there will be disagreements and conflicts, but the important part is the team to stick together and commit completely once the decision has been made. The most important building block here is that all voices have to be heard, else this unconditional commitment will be somehow notional (read absent).

For startups who want to try decentralisation, they can do so at the fringes as an experiment e.g perhaps some areas which are non-core to the business and where failure can be readily absorbed. If this delivers, it will translate into confidence for all to show that decentralisation can work and be widely adopted, and the organisation can grow.
