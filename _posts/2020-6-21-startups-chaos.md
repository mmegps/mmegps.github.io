Startups and chaos go hand in hand, as they work in a dynamic environments, continuously adapt and are on a journey.

Startups also do more with less, but let's focus on chaos.

There are two types of chaos in startups. Good chaos and bad chaos, analogous to cholesterol in the human body.

Good cholesterol is necessary for you and helps build other body cells and hormones, whilst bad cholesterol blocks the blood vessels and prevents normal functioning. In a similar way, in a startup, good chaos quickly reinforces what is working and helps build capability to function where necessary, while the other type hinders progress, reduces effectiveness and blocks building sufficient setup for scale and leverage.

Good chaos is good tension due to being insufficiently resourced to support customer demands and being diplomatic on traction in order to build the organisation for success. Bad chaos arises due to continuously evolving positioning, unable to say “no", and pursuing multiple orthogonal opportunities and ending up thin on resources.

The first one in inevitable and natural as it strengthens muscle where necessary on continuously improving understanding and validation on early assumptions. On the other hand, the second one self-inflicted, basically a feeling of being overwhelmed due to the lack of focus. Often because of being fickle on opportunities.

The first is a rejuvenator and lets everyone involved think about how best to utilise what is available, and the second a disrupter, which hampers progress even with good intentions.

The first generates meaningful work, while the second generates meaningless motion.

The first is a constant introspection, and the second is constant search.

The first is a converging search for ground truth and what works out there, and the second, an endless endeavour without enough fuel to fire it.

Even with honest and purest intentions, attempting to consume available resources with the same thinking as large established firms can never yield fruit for startups. Not because of high burn rate, but because the innovation advantages originating from being small, nimble, resourceful and agile are lost in the chase diluting the efforts.

Someone has rightly said… more startups die of indigestion than starvation.
